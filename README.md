# TSSANDTLB_Godot
This is the 4th redo of the The Silly Slime & The Ludircrous Boy. 
You can't see the other repositories, caused I deleted the last 2.
But...
Now I'm making it in a new engine. GODOT!
As I have stated before, problems will occur. That is now. 
Working on Godot is a struggle, since it is such a unique IDE that I am not used to at all
But I know I can do it. I can perservere (Don't know if thats right) and 
get over the struggles and make this game into reality
