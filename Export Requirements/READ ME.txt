Hi
I would like to say thank you. For playing the demo. 
I'm sorry if you expected more, I was working on another game at the time (very unwise)
I just hope you appreciate it. This took some long nights to complete. 

							Special Thanks

					This thanks is from the Game Maker Version.


I would like to thank all the people who have playtested my game:

	369071 2458
	Jason Pelkey
	Conall Fossoy
	Ivann Gomez


And to the people that I have come across who have helped me in this journey:

	Mr.Winikka - very cool teacher, helpful and kinda gave me the idea for this game
	
	Jason Pelkey - A fellow coder in his game SE/\/SE and Market Metals. They have worked on it for about a year or 2. Don't remember. But they are very smart. And I mean VERY. 
	
	Shawn Spalding - One of the pillars of Game Maker tutorials. Without him, none of this code would be possible. He is straight-foward, to the point, and informative. His tutorials are great as well. Especially the Complete Platformer Tutorial. Great stuff. 
	
	1up Indie - His videos are pretty well made, with the most useful vids are for his enemy AI.
	
	Blobfish - He's the guy that started it all. Since I'm trying to find all the people that gave out the tutorials for the code, I'm going to give credit to them. And this guy is a great person for tutorials. His tutorials are super simple, easy to follow, and quick. It was his platformer tutorial that helped me get started one this game journey. 

	Game Maker's Toolkit - He makes great game design videos that I put into my game.




							Now for the Godot version.

Thank you for the playtesters. 

Riley (I don't know her last name)

Luke Sears

Roy.


For the tutorial men, especially Heartbeast. He was the most useful. Especially with the ground floor of the game




Thank you for everything :]
